"KeterYG" fonts are a "modernized" version of the letter forms
from the Aleppo Codex from the begining of 10th century CE.
The font includes Latin glyphs (only basic Latin) based
on the "Carolingian Miniscule" letter forms used between
800 to 1200CE.

The fontforge sources are in the SFD folder. The fonts
themselves, in .ttf format, are in the TTF folders.

The "KeterYG" Medium and MediumOblique varians fully (almost) support
Hebrew vowels and cantillation marks (Niqud and Taamim) positioning.
In the Bold variants the cantillation marks (Taamim) were made transparent,
thus text including them should still be displayed with proper 
positioning of the niqud.

The Samples folder includes the following files 
test.pdf                     -  Shows some special cases of mark positioning
KeterAramTsova-Devarim28.pdf -  Shows a part of chapter 28 from the
                                Book of Deuteronomy.
Tehilim.pdf                  -  Psalms chapter 1 written with the font

To correctly display text with cantillation marks one should keep the
following typing order:
    Base Letter (consonant)
    Shin/Sin dot
    Dagesh/Rafe
    Niqud (vowel sign)
    Lower cantillation marks
    Upper cantillation marks.

See the file test.pdf for the treatement of meteg (siluq).

Well, like with all rules, there are exceptions. 
To properely position the lower right marks - yetiv and dehi,
they should be typed before vowel marks, meteg and any other cantillation
marks. I am sure that there are some more exceptions.

Of course you will need a keyboard map that supports cantillation marks.
The Tiro keyboard available at
http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx
can be used for Windows and OS/X. A keyboard layout based on Tiro
is available in most Linux distributions.
